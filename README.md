Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server. A decentralized solution to commercial platforms, it avoids the risks of a single company monopolizing your communication. Anyone can run Mastodon and participate in the social network seamlessly.

An alternative implementation of the GNU social project. Based on [ActivityStreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_Streams_(format)), [Webfinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger), [WebSub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub) and [Salmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_(protocol)).

The project focus is a clean REST API and a good user interface. Ruby on Rails is used for the back-end, while React.js and Redux are used for the dynamic front-end. A static front-end for public resources (profiles and statuses) is also provided.

## Features

- **Fully interoperable with GNU social and any OStatus platform**

- **Real-time timeline updates**
  See the updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets
- **Federated thread resolving**
  If someone you follow replies to a user unknown to the server, the server fetches the full thread so you can view it without leaving the UI
- **Media attachments like images and WebM**
  Upload and view images and WebM videos attached to the updates
- **OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API**
  Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider so 3rd party apps can use the API, which is RESTful and simple
- **Background processing for long-running tasks**
  Mastodon tries to be as fast and responsive as possible, so all long-running tasks that can be delegated to background processing, are
- **Deployable via Docker**
